h3. WHAT'S HERE ?

I'm sharing tools I'm using when I build "Datawarehouses":http://blog.logeek.fr/2008/1/19/a-beginner-s-guide-to-datawarehouse using "ActiveWarehouse-ETL":http://activewarehouse.rubyforge.org/etl/.

h3. QUICK DESCRIPTION

* CsvHelper - allows to:
** extract csv columns names in a stable fashion
** returns all the values of a specific column
* FixedWidthFileDestination : if you're outputting stuff to COBOL machines
* DimensionMigrationHelper : useful for ActiveRecord migrations
* French(Date/Time)DimensionBuilder : fine-grained date/time dimensions in french
* EnsureFieldsPresenceProcessor : raises error as soon as one field is missing from a row
* EscapeCSVProcessor : replaces \" by "" in hope FasterCSV will be able to munge your CSV afterwards
* CleanUpTransform : like AW-ETL DecodeTransform, but leave the original value if no match is found

h3. RUNNING SPECS

rake spec

Note: you'll need to gem install activewarehouse-etl and fastercsv

h3. TO BE ADDED

* chunk-splitters bulk load processor to cope with mysql timeouts on Windows
